Imagine these two scenarios:

Scenario one: you’re in a car with a friend and you’re the one playing the music. You’re nervous that your friend won’t like the song that you’re about to play.

Scenario two: you’re hanging out with a group of friends and they ask you to play the music. You’re nervous that you might choose a song that not everybody will like.

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a playlist that combines music that everyone will like? With Sync, you can make sure that you’re playing the right song for the right group of people, so that no matter what song you play, everyone will like it.

Sync utilizes Spotify’s Web API to get information about public playlists that you and your friends listen to. Sync then creates a synced playlist that contains overlapping music from you and your friends’ playlists. As an added feature, Sync will email the synced playlist to you and your friends so you can save your sync to Spotify.
